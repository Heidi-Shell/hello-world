# hello-world

Hey!

My name is Heidi Shell. I am currently an 8th grader living in Owasso, Oklahoma. My future aspiration is to be a software engineer, and hopefully this website will teach me the basics of programming and computer science. I also enjoy writing and music; Journalism is my elective while Choir is my future elective. My twitter name is @ptx_glee, where I talk about my favorite singers and TV-shows.
